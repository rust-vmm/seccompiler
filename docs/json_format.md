## JSON file format

A JSON file expresses the seccomp policy for a process. It may contain multiple
filters, which can be semantically mapped to thread types in multithreaded
applications, and is specific to just one target platform of the application.

At the top level, the file requires an object that maps unique string keys to
seccomp filters:

```
{
    "vmm": {
       "default_action": {
            "errno" : -1
       },
       "filter_action": "allow",
       "filter": [...]
    },
    "api": {...},
    "vcpu": {...},
}
```

The associated filter is a JSON object containing the `default_action`,
`filter_action` and `filter` properties.

The `default_action` represents the action executed if none of the rules in
`filter` match, and `filter_action` is what gets executed if a rule in the
filter matches (e.g: `"Allow"` in the case of implementing an allowlist).

An **action** is the JSON representation of the following enum:

```rust
pub enum SeccompAction {
    Allow, // Allows syscall.
    Errno(u32), // Returns from syscall with specified error number.
    KillThread, // Kills calling process.
    KillProcess, // Kills calling thread.
    Log, // Same as allow but logs call.
    Trace(u32), // Notifies tracing process of the caller with respective number.
    Trap, // Sends `SIGSYS` to the calling process.
}
```

The `filter` property specifies the set of rules that would trigger a match.
This is an array containing multiple **or-bound SyscallRule** **objects**
(if one of them matches, the corresponding action gets triggered).

The **SyscallRule** object is used for adding a rule to a syscall.
It has an optional `args` property that is used to specify a vector of
and-bound conditions that the syscall arguments must satisfy in order for the
rule to match.

In the absence of the `args` property, the corresponding action will get
triggered by any call that matches that name, irrespective of the argument
values.

Here is the structure of the object:

```
{
    "syscall": "accept4", // mandatory, the syscall name
    "comment": "Used by vsock & api thread", // optional, for adding comments
    "args": [...] // optional, vector of and-bound conditions for the arguments
}
```

Note that the file format expects syscall names, not arch-specific numbers, for
increased usability. This is not true, however for the syscall arguments, which
are expected as base-10 integers.

In order to allow a syscall with multiple alternatives for the same parameters,
one can write multiple syscall rule objects at the filter-level, each with its
own, distinct rules.

A **condition object** is made up of the following mandatory properties:

- `index` (0-based index of the syscall argument we want to check)
- `type` (`dword` or `qword`, which specifies the argument size - 4 or 8
    bytes respectively)
- `op`, which is one of `eq, ge, gt, ge, lt, masked_eq, ne` (the operator used
    for comparing the parameter to `val`)
- `val` is the integer value being checked against

As mentioned eariler, named parameters are not supported in the JSON file, but
only numeric constants. One can provide meaning to each numeric value, much
like when using named parameters, by using the optional `comment` property:

```
{
    "syscall": "accept4",
    "args": [
        {
            "index": 3,
            "type": "dword",
            "op": "eq",
            "val": 1,
            "comment": "libc::AF_UNIX"
        }
    ]
}
```
